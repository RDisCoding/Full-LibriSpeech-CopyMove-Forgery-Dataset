# Full LibriSpeech Copy–Move Forgery Dataset

## 📘 Overview

The **Full LibriSpeech Copy–Move Forgery Dataset** is a benchmark created to support research in **audio forgery detection**, particularly **copy–move manipulation** detection and localization. In copy–move forgery, segments from a single audio file are duplicated and repositioned, making detection difficult for traditional verification systems.

This dataset provides cleanly partitioned, speaker-disjoint splits (train/validation/test), detailed temporal annotations, and multiple forgery strength levels to facilitate reproducible and fair evaluation of deep learning models.
