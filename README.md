# Full LibriSpeech Copy‚ÄìMove Forgery Dataset

## üìò Overview

The **Full LibriSpeech Copy‚ÄìMove Forgery Dataset** is a benchmark created to support research in **audio forgery detection**, particularly **copy‚Äìmove manipulation** detection and localization. In copy‚Äìmove forgery, segments from a single audio file are duplicated and repositioned, making detection difficult for traditional verification systems.

This dataset provides cleanly partitioned, speaker-disjoint splits (train/validation/test), detailed temporal annotations, and multiple forgery strength levels to facilitate reproducible and fair evaluation of deep learning models.
